h1. About phpScaffold

*phpScaffold* quickly generates simple CRUD scaffold pages for PHP/MySQL. It
takes a table dump and some file names as input from a browser session, and
cooks XHTML pages for editing the model.

It features basic HTTP or Session based authentication; and the generated
forms responds to column types @text@, @date@, @datetime@, @(var)char@ and
@bool (int(1))@.

I've started it from the public copy at phpscaffold.com, to be able to use it
in any new simple model I need, without having to tweak by hand automatable
tasks (_id est_, for no more reinventing wheels!).


h2. Installation and usage

# Go to @index.php@, and seed the form with your table schema.
# You can go to @tmp/table_name/@ to grab the files (make sure that @tmp/@ has
  write permissions), or copy&paste the code from the shown textareas to where
  you want.
# Adjust MySQL configuration and login (by default it's 'admin', 'pass') from
  first lines of @functions.php@.
# Start using it!

p{font-size:80%}. The table must be up and running; *phpScaffold* doesn't
change anything in the database.


h2. To do list

* Session based authentication, or no one.
* Make it aware of blob columns (upload to file-system).
* Table name and titles get broken if 'name' column exists.
