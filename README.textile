h1. About phpScaffold

*phpScaffold* quickly generates CRUD scaffold pages for PHP/MySQL. It takes a
table dump and some file names as input from a browser session, and cooks
XHTML pages for editing the model.

I've started it from the public copy at phpscaffold.com, to be able to use it
in any new model I need, without having to tweak by hand automatable tasks
(_id est_, for no more reinventing wheels!).


h2. Installation and usage

# Put the files on a PHP server.
# Go to @index.php@, seed it with your table schema.
# Put generated files (copy&paste for now) where you want the CRUD to live,
with following two adjustments to @functions.php@:
## Change @$login@ information (by default it's 'admin', 'pass').
## Edit MySQL connection information.

p{font-size:80%}. Note that the table must be up and running; phpscaffold
doesn't generate it.


h2. To do list

* Modularize forms (print_form in func.php).
* Make it aware of date and blob columns
* "Download all" option doesn't work.
